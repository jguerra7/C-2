	// ARRAYS -------------

	// We have already taken a look at arrays when we stored
	// strings in a character array.
	// An int array is the same type of thing, and array
	// that stores ints.
	// An array can only store elements of the same data type

	char wholeName[12] = "Derek Banas";

	// You can also define an array one element at a time

	int primeNums[3] = {2, 3, 5,};

	// You don't need to define the size if you define
	// the values up front

	int morePrimes[] = {13, 17, 19, 23};

	// Like most other languages the first number in an
	// array is put in the zero index

	printf("The first prime in the list is %d\n\n",
		primeNums[0]);

	// A character array can be created the same way

	char city[7] = {'C', 'h', 'i', 'c', 'a', 'g', 'o'};

	// If I want to print the character array as a string
	// though I have to add \0 at the end

	char anotherCity[5] = {'E', 't', 'n', 'a', '\0'};

	printf("A City %s\n\n", anotherCity);

	// Creating the string like before is easier
	// No quotes and an automatic null at the end

	char thirdCity[] = "Paris";

	// Once an array is defined we can change the value with
	// strcpy() but make sure if you do that that the new
	// array is of the same size, or less. Otherwise you will
	// overwrite other data in memory.
	// You have to make your arrays big enough to hold all
	// potential input, but don't over do it, or you'll consume
	// to much memory.

	char yourCity[30];

	printf("What city do you live in? ");

	// scanf() is kind of limited for adding a string to an array
	// 1. It will allow you to overwrite data past the end of
	//     the space allowed
	// 2. It won't allow you to enter spaces unless you define
	//     exactly how they will be entered
	// fgets() has neither of these problems and it also adds a
	// \0 at the end for you. The only negative is that you must
	// provide a size limit for the data being entered

	fgets(yourCity, 30, stdin);

	printf("Hello %s\n\n", yourCity);

	// fgets() Will read in everything up till the end of the array
	// is reached or until a \n is entered and then it will add
	// a \0 at the end. It leaves in the \n though which can be
	// a bad thing.

	// Let's get rid of the '\n'
	// Use -std=c99 since we are initializing i below in the for

	for(int i = 0; i < 30; i++){

		if(yourCity[i] == '\n'){

			yourCity[i] = '\0';
			break;

		}

	}

	printf("Hello %s\n\n", yourCity);

	// Some string functions available

	// strcmp() takes 2 strings and returns a negative number
	// if the first string is less then the second. It returns
	// a positive if the opposite occurs. It returns a 0 if
	// they are equal

	printf("Is your city Paris? %d\n\n",
		strcmp(yourCity, thirdCity));

	// strcat() adds the second string to the end of the first

	char yourState[] = ", Pennsylvania";

	strcat(yourCity, yourState);

	printf("You live in %s\n\n", yourCity);

	// strlen() returns the length of the string minus \0

	printf("Letters in Paris : %d\n\n", strlen(thirdCity));

	// As mentioned before strcpy() is bad for copying strings
	// because it can overwrite memory.
	// That is were strlcpy() comes in.
	// It won't overwrite memory and it always adds a \0

	strlcpy(yourCity,
		"El Pueblo del la Reina de Los Angeles",
		sizeof(yourCity));

	printf("The new name is %s\n\n", yourCity);
