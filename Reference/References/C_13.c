// With C we can actually work with individual bits.
// This is very useful if you want to work with hardware.

// What we use for counting is known as base 10.
// Base 10 numbers are calculated by multiplying each
// successive number by an increasing multiple of ten.
// 2 = 2 * 10^0
// 45 = ( 4 * 10^1 ) + ( 5 * 10^0 )

// It is believed we use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.
// To understand computers you must learn to understand the world
// of a machine that has only 2 fingers.

// 1 = 1 * 2^0 = 1
// 10 = ( 1 * 2^1  ) + ( 0 * 2^0  ) = 2
// 111 = ( 1 * 2^2  )   +  ( 1 * 2^1  )   +  ( 1 * 2^0  ) = 7

// Bytes are normally represented as 8 bits which can hold a
// maximum value of 255 because of how binary numbers work.

// Octal is a base 8 system. It includes numbers from 0 to 7
// They are often used because each octal digit represents 3
// binary digits.

// Hexadecimal is a base 16 system. It includes numbers 0 through
// 9 and the letters A through F. In C they can be represented with
// either lowercase or uppercase letters. Hex numbers are used because
// 2 digits can represent a byte.
